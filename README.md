# Hierarchical-RAG
Hierarchical RAG is a powerful conversational agent that integrates hierarchical topic modeling and the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model for interactive, context-aware question answering. Notably, this project distinguishes itself by avoiding the use of vectorization, providing a unique approach to information retrieval. Additionally, it allows users to query any Wikipedia page, expanding the scope of information exploration.
